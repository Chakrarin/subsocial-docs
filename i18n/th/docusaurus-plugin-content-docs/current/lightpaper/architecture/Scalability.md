Subsocial allows communities to create their own space on top of the Subsocial chain, such that
all communities share the same underlying blockchain. This provides shared network effects:
users will be able to seamlessly join any community on any alternative clients for Subsocial. In
addition, anyone with a Polkadot or Kusama address can easily join a Subsocial community.
