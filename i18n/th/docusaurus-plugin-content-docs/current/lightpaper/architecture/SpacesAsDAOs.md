title: Spaces as DAOs
---

The functionality provided by the Roles & Permissions modules is reminiscent of a DAO’s
characteristics. That is, a space on Subsocial could be run as a DAO. Subsocial allows multiple
owners (via multisig) who can control and monetize the content.

Each space can have its own token, therefore space ownership can be represented as a stake
in the space’s token. Similarly, each space could evolve by its own governance mechanism
(including token holder governance). As a result of this, each space could have its own treasury
that’s controlled by its token holders.

Governance can be used to modify space permissions, roles, elect moderators, or even
collectively decide how to block unwanted content.

In order to make trading easier between the space tokens, it would be possible to exchange
them for Subsocial tokens first.
