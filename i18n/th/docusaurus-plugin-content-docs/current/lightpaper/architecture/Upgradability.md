title: Upgradability
---

Substrate allows blockchains to be seamlessly upgraded without hardforks. We have already
witnessed forkless upgrades in Polkadot and Kusama. The same on-chain governance and
upgrade mechanisms are available to all Substrate-based blockchains.

This approach to blockchain technology is perfect for Subsocial. We believe that it isnâ€™t possible
to know everything upfront. Functionality and parameters the platform will have to be changed
all the way as the community finds bugs or it becomes necessary to make improvements.
