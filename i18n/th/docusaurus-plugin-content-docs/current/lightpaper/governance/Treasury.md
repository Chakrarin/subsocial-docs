The Subsocial treasury is a chain-level pot of tokens that can be spent on community proposals
to help further the project and its ecosystem. It is envisioned that the treasury could sponsor
chain development, creating different web and mobile apps, alternative feed algorithms, growing
the community, and marketing.

Where we see one area of improvement over, say Kusamaâ€™s treasury, is to have three councils
to cover the three aforementioned aspects of treasury expenditure. Each council will ideally be
made up of experts in that domain: technology, UX, and marketing.
