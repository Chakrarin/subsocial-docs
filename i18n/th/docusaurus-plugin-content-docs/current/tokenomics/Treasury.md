Subsocial will follow the lead of Polkadot and Kusama by implementing an on-chain treasury
which is controlled by token holders. We are planning to have two councils, one which is
technical and the other is focused on ecosystem growth.

We have not made a final decision on when on-chain governance (and hence the treasury) will
be initiated.

As noted above, we plan for the treasury to receive 25% of inflation rewards.
