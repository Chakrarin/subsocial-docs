title: Parachain vs Parathread
---

> A chain developed with Substrate can at different points in its lifetime assume one of three
states: an independent chain with a secured bridge, a parachain, or a parathread. ([source](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/ru/learn-parathreads))

Subsocial is planning to be a parachain of Kusama, if that is successful then we will consider
also launching a parachain for Polkadot but provide no guarantee that will happen.

If Subsocial is unsuccessful in launching a parachain, it will consider launching instead as a
parathread. In that case, no tokens will be generated for the users who wished to participate in
the PLO (as the action was unsuccessful).

As a parathread we would need to purchase KSM or DOT to pay for block inclusion. To cover
this cost, one option would be to sell our native chain token.
