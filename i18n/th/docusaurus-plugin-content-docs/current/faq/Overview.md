## Will there be a presale? If so, how can I participate? How can I participate in a presale?

ตอนนี้ยังไม่เปิด pre-sale

## Will there be an IDO? If so, how can I participate? When IDO?

An IDO is not possible for the SUB token. Subsocial is not built on Ethereum and is not an ERC20 token. Most existing DEXs operate on Ethereum-based chains and work with ERC20 tokens. Therefore, an IDO for the SUB token would not be supported on these DEXs.

## Will there be an IEO? If so, How can I participate?

The team is currently looking into an IEO, but nothing has been announced yet. Follow our [announcements channel](/docs/faq/overview#do-you-have-an-announcement-channel) to keep updated.

## Is there a way to get free tokens in order to use the Subsocial app?

You can get some free tokens at our token faucet (after you confirm your email address):
https://app.subsocial.network/faucet

## How can I buy tokens?

Currently (as of 2021-05-17) it is not possible to buy tokens, but you can get some tokens for free: see [How to get free tokens](/docs/faq/overview#is-there-a-way-to-get-free-tokens-in-order-to-use-the-subsocial-app)?

## What is the name of Subsocial’s token?

The name of the token is **SUB**. It was previously SMN, but was changed as of 2021-05-19.

## What is the total token supply (how many tokens)?

The total amount of tokens is 100m tokens. It was previously 10m tokens, but there was a 1:10 redenomination on 2021-05-19. This was done similar to Polkadot's 1:100 redenomination [1:100 redenomination on Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/tag/redenomination/). 

## Is Subsocial token an ERC20 token?

**No**. Subsocial has its own native token built on the Substrate blockchain framework. Our token uses the same technology as DOT, KSM, EDG, and other tokens of Substrate-based chains.

## Where can I see smart contracts of Subsocial?

There are no smart contracts for Subsocial, because it is built as a custom performant blockchain on top of the [Substrate](https://substrate.dev/) blockchain framework. Subsocial blockchain is optimized for social networking type of operations and it has very low fees.

## How to start using Subsocial?

Install the **Polkadot.js** extension in your browser. This extension allows you to sign transactions for Subsocial blockchain. It’s similar to MetaMask – a browser extension for Ethereum blockchain.

- On Chrome, install via [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd)
- On Firefox, install via [Firefox add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension/)

After the Polkadot extension is installed, create (or import) your account and then you can sign in on the Subsocial web dapp (decentralized application) by visiting this link: https://app.subsocial.network

## Can I use Subsocial on mobile?

You can read posts and comments on mobile devices. Currently (as of 2021-07-29) it’s not possible to use the create or update features for posts/comments, or to use the follow feature for spaces/accounts, on mobile devices. This is because our current web dapp requires the Polkadot.js extension to sign your transactions, and modern mobile browsers (like Chrome and Firefox) do not support the extension.

## I have problems with the Polkadot{.js} extension. What should I do?

### My account is not displayed correctly

Double check that your extension is connected to the web dapp. If so, [page reload](/docs/faq/overview#i-reloaded-a-page-but-it-did-not-help) helps.

### I do not see new accounts from Polkadot.js extension

If you don’t see new Polkadot{.js} accounts on the web dapp in the right sidebar, try to Sign out, [reload the page](/docs/faq/overview#i-reloaded-a-page-but-it-did-not-help), and Sign back in.

### I reloaded a page, but it did not help

We recommend reloading the page with cache clean (Ctrl+F5 in most browsers).

### My transactions fail

In most cases, reloading a page of the Subsocial web dapp should solve your problem. If you still have trouble with sending transactions (when following a space, creating a post or a comment, upvoting, etc.), report it to one of our [official chats](/docs/faq/overview#what-are-the-official-social-links) (preferably main chat in English).
